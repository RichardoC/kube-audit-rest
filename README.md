# kube-audit-rest

Want to get a kubernetes audit log without having the ability to configure the kube-api-server such as with [EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html), [GKE](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/185868707) or [AKS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/monitor-aks#collect-resource-logs)?
Use kube-audit-rest to capture all mutation/creation API calls to disk, before exporting those to your logging infrastructure.
This should be much cheaper than the Cloud Service Provider managed offerings which charges ~ per API call and don't support ingestion filtering.

If you do control the kube-api-server then use the [built in audit logging](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/), not kube-audit-rest

This tool is maintained and originally created by [Richard Tweed](https://github.com/RichardoC)

## What this is

A simple logger of mutation/creation requests to the k8s api.

## What this isn't

A filtering/redaction/forwarder system. This can be done with many different tools, so this tool doesn't rely on any specific tooling. Examples of using kube-audit-rest with Elastic Search can be found in <examples/full-elastic-stack/README.md>

## Why should I care?

You can use kube-audit-rest to avoid bills of thousands of dollars per cluster per year for non-filterable Kubernetes audit logs.

With kube-audit-rest you can configure exactly which events are recorded and directly send them to your SIEM, dramatically reducing storage and ingestion charges compared with only on/off configurations such as [EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html)

## Kubernetes distribution compatibility

Unknown but likely to work with all distributions due to how fundamental the ValidatingWebhook API is to Kubernetes operators. At worst the MutatingAdmissionWebhook API can be used instead, though that does mean that subverting this binary could lead to a cluster takeover and that it may not log the final version of the object.

## Usage

An example of how to deploy this service can be found within `./k8s` and steps to actually deploy it in `testing/setup.sh`
You could either run this centrally (though it would be difficult to tell which API calls are from which clusters) or running in each cluster.
At minimum you require

- Ability to create ValidatingWebhookConfiguration on the target k8s cluster.
- A CA, and a TLS certificate signed for the address the kubernetes control plane is connecting to for connections to kube-audit-rest
- kube-audit-rest running somewhere connectable by the kubernetes control plane.
- some disk space for kube-audit-rest to write to. Defaults to `/tmp` which is a ramfs on most linux distributions, though not on Kubernetes.
- Either to build a copy of the binary yourself, or download a copy of the docker image via the steps on the [packages page](https://github.com/RichardoC/kube-audit-rest/pkgs/container/kube-audit-rest) which is available as a distroless image (default, and `latest`) with suffix -distroless and a -alpine image based on the alpine docker image.

If you are running kube-audit-rest within the kubernetes cluster it is auditing you also require

- a deployment of kube-audit-rest running
- a service targeting the kube-audit-rest pods

## Image variants

kube-audit-rest images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

These are all available for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64

VERSION refers to github release versions

COMMIT refers to the commits to main

### Available container tags

While the tags below exist, it is recommended to pin to the digest of the container image you wish to use, these can be found on <https://github.com/RichardoC/kube-audit-rest/pkgs/container/kube-audit-rest/>

#### VERSION-distroless

This is the preferred image for production usage, it only contains the required kube-audit-rest binary, and nothing else.

This means it has the minimum size (~ 14 MB) and number of container layers which decreases image pull time.

Since it doesn't contain an OS, or any other packages this will contain the minimum possible (reported) vulnerabilities.

#### VERSION-alpine

This is the preferred image for development usage, it contains the required kube-audit-rest binary, and uses a default alpine image containing a shell.

This is larger, but since it contains a shell and other useful utilities it's the best one for experimenting with kube-audit-rest and diagnosing issues.

#### COMMIT-distroless

Generated container images will be pushed for every commit, so you can experiment with new functionality or bug fixes while waiting for an official release to be genenerated. Otherwise this is the same as `VERSION-distroless`

#### COMMIT-alpine

Generated container images will be pushed for every commit, so you can experiment with new functionality or bug fixes while waiting for an official release to be genenerated. Otherwise this is the same as `VERSION-alpine`

#### latest

This points to the latest `VERSION-distroless` image and is only recommended for demo purposes. Use versioned images for stable usage.

### Binary options

```

### Example usage

These can be found in the <./examples> directory, and documented in this readme.

### Resource requirements

Unknown, if anyone performs benchmarks please open a pull request with your findings. These can be set by following the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

Current values seem to deal with > 12 requests per second.

### Limiting which requests are logged

In your `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` use the limited amount of resources and verbs you wish to log, rather than the `*`s in `./k8s/webhook.yaml` using the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#webhook-configuration)

## API spec for kube-audit-rest output

This is the [AdmissionRequest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/apiserver-admission.v1/#admission-k8s-io-v1-AdmissionRequest) request with requestReceivedTimestamp injected in RFC3339 format (see #26 for why).

kube-audit-rest will log one request per line, in compacted json.

### Example

```console
{"kind":"AdmissionReview","apiVersion":"admission.k8s.io/v1","request":{"uid":"f452d444-9782-45ce-8eea-85e7c5a2801b","kind":{"group":"authorization.k8s.io","version":"v1","kind":"SelfSubjectAccessReview"},"resource":{"group":"authorization.k8s.io","version":"v1","resource":"selfsubjectaccessreviews"},"requestKind":{"group":"authorization.k8s.io","version":"v1","kind":"SelfSubjectAccessReview"},"requestResource":{"group":"authorization.k8s.io","version":"v1","resource":"selfsubjectaccessreviews"},"operation":"CREATE","userInfo":{"username":"system:admin","groups":["system:masters","system:authenticated"]},"object":{"kind":"SelfSubjectAccessReview","apiVersion":"authorization.k8s.io/v1","metadata":{"creationTimestamp":null,"managedFields":[{"manager":"steve","operation":"Update","apiVersion":"authorization.k8s.io/v1","time":"2022-11-30T17:46:52Z","fieldsType":"FieldsV1","fieldsV1":{"f:spec":{"f:resourceAttributes":{".":{},"f:group":{},"f:resource":{},"f:verb":{},"f:version":{}}}}}]},"spec":{"resourceAttributes":{"verb":"list","group":"helm.cattle.io","version":"v1","resource":"helmchartconfigs"}},"status":{"allowed":false}},"oldObject":null,"dryRun":false,"options":{"kind":"CreateOptions","apiVersion":"meta.k8s.io/v1"}},"requestReceivedTimestamp":"2023-02-04T21:56:41.610688981Z"}

```

## Metrics

kube-audit-rest provide some metrics describing its own operations, both as an application specifically and as a go binary. .

All the specific application metrics are prefixed with `kube_audit_rest_`.

| Metric name                                    | Metric type | Labels | Description                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| kube_audit_rest_valid_requests_processed_total | Counter     |        | Total number of valid requests processed    |
| kube_audit_rest_http_requests_total            | Counter     |        | Total number of requests to kube-audit-rest |

kube-audit-rest also exposes all default go metrics from the (Prometheus Go collector)[https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/main/prometheus/go_collector.go]

## Building

Requires docker and rancher desktop as a way of building/testing locally with k8s.

```bash
./testing/setup.sh

# To cleanup
./testing/cleanup.sh
```

### Testing

Run via the Building commands, then the following should contain various admission requests

```bash
kubectl -n kube-audit-rest logs -l app=kube-audit-rest
```

Confirm that the k8s API is happy with this webhook (log location may vary, check Rancher Desktop docs)
If it's working there should be no mention of this webook.

```bash
vim $HOME/.local/share/rancher-desktop/logs/k3s.log
```

Example failures

```

```

### Local testing

This requires the [go toolchain for Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/doc/install), openssl and bash installed.

```bash
testing/locally/local-testing.sh
...
Test passed
{"level":"info","msg":"Server is shutting down...","time":"2022-12-01T19:43:01Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Server stopped","time":"2022-12-01T19:43:01Z"}
Terminated
```

If this failed, you will see `output not as expected`

### Unit tests

The individual components that create this application have unittests. To run them

```
go test ./...
```

## Guide for developers

If you want to know how the project is structured and/or you want to colaborate in it, you can read the following
document: [ForDevelopers](docs/ForDevelopers.md)

## Known limitations and warnings

From the k8s documentation [see rules](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.25/#validatingwebhook-v1-admissionregistration-k8s-io)

```text
Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule. However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.
```

This webhook also cannot know that all other validating webhooks passed so may log requests that were failed by other validating webhooks afterwards.

Due to the `failure: ignore` in the example webhook configurations there may be missing requests that were not logged in the interests of availability of the kubernetes API..

WARNING: This will log all details of the request! This namespace should be very locked down to prevent privilege escalation!

This webhook will also record dry-run requests.

The audit log files will only exist if valid API calls are sent to the webhook binary.

API calls can be logged repeatedly due to Kubernetes repeatedly re-calling the [webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#reinvocation-policy) and thus may not be in chronological order.

WARNING: This can only log mutation/creation requests. Read Only requests are _not_ sent to mutating or validating webhooks unfortunately.

Due to how dynamic admisson control works on managed Kubernetes clusters, kube-audit-rest is unable to verfiy that the requests are coming from the control plane, so there is the risk that an attacker could flood the logs with nonsense. This could be rectified by registering kube-audit-rest as a custom API (with https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/apiserver-runtime https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/) and using that custom API as the webhook, as the api server uses MTLS to authenticate but this risks causing denial of service if the kube-audit-rest server is down, so won't be done for now.

kube-audit-rest will not be able to write audit logs if the host disks are full.

### Certificate expires/invalid

The application logs will be full of the following error, and you will _not_ get any more audit logs until this is fixed.
`2022/11/27 15:36:42 http: TLS handshake error from 10.42.0.1:46380: EOF`

Kubernetes may not load balance between replicas of kube-audit-rest in the way you expect as this behaviour appears to be undocumented.

### Read only actions not logged

Unfortunately the admission controllers are only called for mutations and creations, so this cannot be used to capture read only API calls.

Some well behaved API clients will create a `SubjectAccessReview` before making any API call. These can be used to spot all API calls made by those clients, but this is not required (and most clients don't.)

## Next steps

- explain zero stability guarantees until above completed
- follow GH best practises for workflows/etc
- add prometheus metrics, particularly for total requests dealt with/request latency/invalid certificate refusal from client as this probably needs an alert as the cert needs replaced...
- make it clear just how bad an idea stdout is, preferably with a PoC exploit of using that to take over a cluster via logs...
- have the testing main.go spin up/shut down the binaries rather than using bash and make it clearer that diff is required.

## Completed next steps

- Use flags for certs locations
- write to a file rather than STDOUT with rotation and/or a max size
- Use structured logging
- rename to kube-audit-rest from kube-rest-audit
- Add examples folder
- Add local testing
- use zap for logging rather than logrus for prettier http error logs
- despite the issues, make it possible to log to stdout/stderr, as useful for capturing less sensitive info directly without infra
- upload images on git commit
- make a distroless version
- clarify logs are not guaranteed to be ordered because there aren't guarantees from k8s that the requests would arrive in order.
- explain how to limit resources it's logging via the webhook resource (just a link to the k8s docs)
- make it clear log file only exists if requests are sent
- clarify log file format is the raw response with no newlines in the json, with one response per line.
- clarify that kubernetes may not loadbalance between replicas as expected.
- document that image defaults to distroless
- add simple metrics
- test properly rather than use sleeps to manage async things...
- Correctly configure GOMAXPROCS to reduce unhelpful throttling
- have workflow to test that docker image can be created once a maintainer adds a label to the PR.
- Make it clear this only tracks mutations due to limitations of the k8s api.
- Show kube-audit-rest working with a full elastic stack
